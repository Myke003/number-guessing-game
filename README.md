# Number Guessing Game 🎲

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, a simple Python project where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100! This project is designed as a learning exercise inspired by the **roadmap.sh** developer paths.

## 📋 Features
- Three difficulty levels:
  - Easy: 10 attempts.
  - Medium: 5 attempts.
  - Hard: 3 attempts.
- Validation for user inputs to ensure smooth gameplay.
- Option to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.
- Friendly messages guiding the player through the game.
- Fully implemented in Python for simplicity and accessibility.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the game using Python.
2. Choose a difficulty level.
3. Guess the number by entering your choice.
4. Follow the hints (`greater` or `less than`) to narrow down your guesses.
5. Try to guess the correct number before running out of attempts!
6. Once a round ends, decide whether to play again or exit the game.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Myke003/number-guessing-game.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

``` cd number-guessing-game```
  
3. Run the game

```python game.py```

🧠 Learning Objectives
This project is part of my roadmap.sh learning path and focuses on:

 - Implementing control structures like loops and conditionals.
 - Managing user input and validating errors.
 - Structuring code with classes and methods for modularity.
 - Practicing Python's exception handling.
